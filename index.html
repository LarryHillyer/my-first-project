    <p>Jake did an excellcent job. I learned a lot. I did not know about Cmder at all. We did have some problems setting up the enviroment variable some that it could 
        launch both node and code. Git worked without any changes. We learned some of the basics of git, In Code we got git set up to be able to pus, pull, and sysnc by downloading:
        <br /><br>
        URL Link: GitHubMicrosoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows<br/>
        <br><br>
        
        In Cmder: "git config credential.helper manager"   <br><br>
        
        We then setup a website using gh-pages in GitHub. At that point we put everything together and then started editing the web site in code. Saving the changes, and Using git the pull, then push to server.  In github we then did a pull request with the master., then merged the master to gh-pages, and finally confirmed the merge.  Then on the website, we would reload the page. </p>
