    <p>Jake did an excellcent job. I learned a lot. I did not know about Cmder at all. We did have some problems setting up the enviroment variable some that it could 
        launch both node and code. Git worked without any changes. We learned some of the basics of git pushing, pulling, and syncing.
        In Code we got git set up to be able to pus, pull, and sysnc by downloading: <br /><br>
        GitHubMicrosoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows<br/>
        <br><br>
        
        and then  running "git config credential.helper manager" in Cmder.  We then setup a website using gh-pages in GitHub </p>
